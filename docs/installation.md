# Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the Generative AI Descriptor project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the Generative AI Descriptor repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/AI-Innovators/Generative-AI-Descriptor.git>
```

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
Creating a virtual environment is recommended to isolate the dependencies for this project from your global Python environment. Use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux and macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project's root directory (where the requirements.txt file is located) and install the required Python packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Configure API Keys and Credentials
To access GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B and other external services, you'll need to obtain the necessary API keys and credentials. Place these keys in a configuration file or environment variables as required by the project.

## Step 5: Run the Application
Navigate to the src/user_interface directory and run the app.py file to start the application:
```
python app.py
```

You should now be able to interact with the Generative AI Descriptor through the chatbot-style user interface.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please check the following:

Ensure you have the correct version of Python and pip installed
Verify that you have installed all required packages from the requirements.txt file
Make sure you have the necessary API keys and credentials configured
If the problem persists, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

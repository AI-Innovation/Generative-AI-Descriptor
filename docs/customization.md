# Customization Guide

Generative AI Descriptor allows users to customize their experience by selecting their preferred media types and personalizing their interaction with the chatbot. This guide provides an overview of the available customization options.

## Media Types

Users can choose from a variety of media types, including:

- Movies
- TV shows
- Graphic novels
- NFTs

Upon creating a user profile, users can select their preferred media types. The application will then filter the dataset and generate descriptions tailored to their preferences.

## Chatbot-style User Interface

The chatbot-style user interface, powered by GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B, provides a conversational experience. Users can ask questions, request descriptions, and interact with the application in a more natural and accessible way.

## Personalization

Users can further personalize their experience with the following options:

- **Preferred genres**: Users can specify their favorite genres, such as action, comedy, or science fiction, to receive recommendations and descriptions that align with their interests.
- **Content rating**: Users can set a preferred content rating (e.g., G, PG, PG-13, R) to ensure that the generated descriptions are suitable for their age group or preferences.
- **Language**: If the application supports multiple languages, users can choose their preferred language for generated descriptions.

## Saving and Loading User Profiles

Users can save their profiles to a file and load them later to maintain their preferences across sessions. This feature enables users to quickly switch between profiles or share profiles with others.

## Feedback and Improvement

User feedback plays a crucial role in improving the quality and relevance of the generated descriptions. Users are encouraged to provide feedback on the descriptions, which can be used to iteratively fine-tune the GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B model and enhance its performance.

## Troubleshooting and Support

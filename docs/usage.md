# Usage Guide

This guide provides an overview of how to interact with the Generative AI Descriptor to obtain accessible and creative descriptions for various media types.

## Step 1: Launch the Application

Make sure you have followed the [installation guide](installation.md) to set up the project on your local machine. Navigate to the `src/user_interface` directory and run the `app.py` file to start the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Step 2: Create a User Profile

Upon launching the application, you will be prompted to create a user profile. Enter your preferences for media types (movies, TV shows, graphic novels, NFTs, etc.) and any other personalization options offered by the application.

## Step 3: Interact with the Chatbot
The chatbot-style user interface allows you to interact with the Generative AI Descriptor in a conversational manner. You can ask the chatbot for descriptions of specific media titles, request recommendations, or make inquiries about particular media types.

Here are some example interactions:

"Tell me about the movie Inception."
"Describe the graphic novel Watchmen."
"What can you tell me about the NFT collection CryptoPunks?"
The chatbot will generate responses based on the GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B model and provide you with accessible descriptions tailored to your preferences.

## Step 4: Save and Load User Profiles (Optional)
You can save your user profile to a file and load it later to maintain your preferences across sessions. Follow the application's prompts for saving and loading user profiles.

## Step 5: Provide Feedback (Optional)
Your feedback is essential to improve the quality and relevance of the generated descriptions. Please consider sharing your thoughts and suggestions on the generated descriptions with the development team.
